<!-- 
Create a basic website!

Start with the home page at index.html
Create pages for individual topics. These can your interest, passions, family, cats, or anything else.
Link the different pages to one another (via nav or links in the content).
Include images
Make use of tags you learned
Make use of CSS styling
Make sure all your html page are validated via plugin (or you can always upload your HTML file here.)
Make 5-10 different pages. Put good content in them
 

A few ideas:

Document a few of the python projects you created with screenshots, pre-formatted code, and a brief description.
Create a hypertext version of notes you've taken during class, including links to external resources.
Create a (hopefully non-creepy) fan page for something you love.
